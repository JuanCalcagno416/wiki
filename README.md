### Why

Because I saw this post on [Dev Community](https://dev.to/aurelio/how-i-remember-everything-i-learn-19mi) about learning, which is a topic where I struggle a bit. And not because I don't pay attention or I don't like the stuff I'm into. Maybe it's just the approach I have. Who knows.

I will start to *document*everything I read or is in my scope of interest. Just for the sake of enhancing what I've been trying to learn.

Also, will try to be updating this repo with all the stuff I've been reading, IF! I don't forget that I'm doing this type of notes or documentation

Btw, don't worry about my super English, it's my second language, so I will try my best
