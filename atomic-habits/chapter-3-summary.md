- A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic
- The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible
- Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps.

Four steps ( feedback loop ):

1. Cue
2. Craving
3. Response
4. Reward

> The cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfie the craving and ultimately
> becomes associated with the cue.

The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can apply to build better habits

1. Make it obvious
2. Make it attractive
3. Make it easy
4. make it satisfying
